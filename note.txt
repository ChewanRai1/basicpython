----String, Number, List, Tuple, Array, Dictionary-----
Tuple are immutable

Data of tuple cannot be delete 
but whole Tuple can be delete

Builtin Tuple are:
all()
any()
enumerate()
min()
max()
sorted()
len()
tuple()

TUPLE OVER LIST
1. Iteration in tuple are faster than list, Since Tuple are immutable
2. Elements of tuple which are immutable can be used as key for dictionary, which is not possible in list
3. Since they are immutable, it remaind write-protected.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dictionay are changable and unordered collection of data values that holds key-value pairs
it is optimized, because every key maps its value.
key is simgle Element
Value can be list or list within list, numbers e.t.c

No duplication in key
Value can be of any type, while key must be immutable.
Dict key are case sensitive.

Dict builtin methods:
dict.copy()
dict.update()
dict.items()
dict.sort()
len(dict)
cmp(dict1, dict2)
Str(dict)  =making printable string format

clear()
append()
update()
pop()

Python Operators
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Comparision Operators
3. Assignment Operators
    +=, -=, *=, /=
4. Logical Operators
    AND= True if both the elements are True
    OR= True is either of  operand is true
    NOT= True is operand is false
5. Membership Operators
    in
    not in
6. Identity Operators
    -used to compare the memory location of two objects
    - is, is not

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Array
- Collection of common type of data structure having elements with same type
- used to store the collectionof data.

USES
to use many variable of same type
to store the collectionof data
when you have to process the data dynamically
Faster than the list as it uses less memory
